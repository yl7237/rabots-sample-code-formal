RABOTS: A Randomized Adaptive Bayesian Optimization Two-stage Seamless Design for Dose Optimization and Proof-of-Concept evaluation

This script contains sample simulation code accompanying the paper

The scripts borrow_non_cutoff_0.1.R, borrow_full_cutoff_0.1.R, and borrow_sam_cutoff_0.1.R illustrate a representative simulation setting (Setting S2, described in Section 3.1 of the main manuscript; see page 5). These scripts reproduce the simulation results reported in Tables 1 and 2 of the main manuscript. Specifically: 

(1) borrow_non_cutoff_0.1.R demonstrates the simulation under the non-informative borrowing strategy.

(2) borrow_full_cutoff_0.1.R demonstrates the simulation under full borrowing.

(3) borrow_sam_cutoff_0.1.R demonstrates the simulation under the SAM prior.
